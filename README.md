This is my social network API built using Express.js and Mongoose

To run the program: 
1. download or clone all folders and files from this repository
2. Install all dev dependencies with "npm install"
3. Run the server file with "npm start"
4. Open Insomnia to view or change database data points.

Below is a video demonstrating functionality of the app. These are my working routes so far. Submitting for a grade currently, but will finish before the class is over.
